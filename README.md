# DogTracker

Dog tracking can be done in multiple ways and one way is for a person to lay a track by walking a distance, for example 500 meters. While walking these 500 meters the person will drop a couple of dumbbells for the dog to find. The track then has to settle for a bit and then the dog gets released into the track and tries to walk the same path while also finding all the dumbbells.

To simplify this process and make it easier for dog owners/trainers we made an app that consists of these features
- Satellite image view 
- Possibility to see the track that you laid
- Mark dumbbells on the map
- See stats like time, distance, deviation
- Register an account and add multiple dogs
- Record your dogs efforts and save tracks that can be viewed at a later point or from different devices
